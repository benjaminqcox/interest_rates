#The task
Create a command line based application that can be used to calculate interest for a single users account
* The program would require a user to input their initial deposit amount, the term length, and the interest of the account
* The user would be able to view the growth of their deposit based on simple interest or compounding interest
* A user should be able to perform actions to update the following items in their account:
    * The term length, the initial deposit, and the interest rate
* The user should not be able to input any negative values, and all function uses should be error checked
* The application must remain in memory, and should not be stored to a file for now
* The program should be compiled using Make, and any utility functions should be called from a separate file
* As an extension, the application could store multiple users, of a fixed amount
If you are attempting this task, please try to avoid using pointers, dynamic memory, and file writing for now, this exercise is allow you to combine everything used so far into one application. Also please make sure to follow good coding practices such as comments, error checking, consistent coding style, etc
